          <h2>How the Environmental Landscape is Changing, Courtesy of COVID-19</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/envi_covid.jpg"></img><br>
            One’s initial reaction to hearing about COVID-19’s impact on the environment might be relief, given that travel would be limited, which would
            decrease carbon emissions from vehicles of all kinds. The quarantine would have also temporarily immobilized some businesses, which could
            potentially lead to a decrease in energy consumption.<br><br>
          Months later, with the statistics from U.S.News, we can say with confidence that it is indeed the case. According to their article,
            there was a 30% decrease in the use of gasoline and jet fuel consumption was cut by half compared to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile
            for power and utilities there was a decrease of almost 20% and there was an almost 10% drop in demand for electricity. This was a 15%
            reduction overall for the U.S., which is a major contributor to global emissions.<br><br>
          However, things are never that simple. While the hinderance to human activity appears to have helped mitigate the damage caused by our
            daily activities, it also stymies the progress being made to transition to cleaner energy sources. As U.S.News notes, investment in low-carbon
            energy was stopped due to the pandemic. The researchers they cited have stated that “pushing back all renewable electricity generation investments
            by one year would outweigh the emissions reductions and avoided deaths from March to June of 2020." This means that while our environmental
            issues seem to be improving on first glance, it is actually worsening in the long run.<br><br>

          <h2>Safety Precautions for Working with Resin</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/diy_resin.jpg"></img><br>
            I was recently scared out of my wits when I saw a reckless newbie experimenting with resin so I decided to post this.<br>
            “Safety first” should be a general rule for anything, that includes working with resin.<br><br>
            Here is what you <b>ABSOLUTELY</b> need:<br>
            1.	Gloves<br>
            2.	Either a well-ventilated workspace or a respirator<br><br>
            If you get resin on your skin <b>NEVER</b> use the following:<br>
            1.	Varsol<br>
            2.	Vinegar<br>
            3.	Alcohol<br>
            4.	Acetone<br><br>
            You can use the above-mentioned for your materials and workspace; but for your lovely skin, just use soap, even better would be an exfoliant.<br>
            If it gets in you eyes, rinse but don’t rub then get yourself to the hospital <b>IMMEDIATELY.</b><br>
            Keep young children away from the area and ensure that your project is unreachable to them.<br><br>
            Additional things you need to know:<br>
            1.	Even in a well-ventilated area, you can wear an N95 mask if you want to be sure.<br>
            2.	Don’t wear clothes you’re not yet willing to part with because stray resin will ruin them.<br>
            3.	Protect your workspace by covering it with a plastic sheet, or any non-stick sheet you might have.<br><br>
            Alright, have fun and don’t die! :D<br></p>
