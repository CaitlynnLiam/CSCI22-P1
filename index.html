          <h2>How the Environmental Landscape is Changing, Courtesy of COVID-19</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/envi_covid.jpg"></img><br>
            One’s initial reaction to hearing about COVID-19’s impact on the environment might be relief, given that travel would be limited, which would
            decrease carbon emissions from vehicles of all kinds. The quarantine would have also temporarily immobilized some businesses, which could
            potentially lead to a decrease in energy consumption.<br><br>
          Months later, with the statistics from U.S.News, we can say with confidence that it is indeed the case. According to their article,
            there was a 30% decrease in the use of gasoline and jet fuel consumption was cut by half compared to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile
            for power and utilities there was a decrease of almost 20% and there was an almost 10% drop in demand for electricity. This was a 15%
            reduction overall for the U.S., which is a major contributor to global emissions.<br><br>
          However, things are never that simple. While the hinderance to human activity appears to have helped mitigate the damage caused by our
            daily activities, it also stymies the progress being made to transition to cleaner energy sources. As U.S.News notes, investment in low-carbon
            energy was stopped due to the pandemic. The researchers they cited have stated that “pushing back all renewable electricity generation investments
            by one year would outweigh the emissions reductions and avoided deaths from March to June of 2020." This means that while our environmental
            issues seem to be improving on first glance, it is actually worsening in the long run.<br><br>

          <h2>Hwasa’s Comeback and Mamamoo’s Upcoming Concert</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/radish_hwasa.jpg"><br>
            Artists are being forced to adapt to change due to the quarantine caused by COVID-19, so it is to our great pleasure to
            say that Moonbyul’s (concert performance thing) was successful despite the constraints that she and the production team were
            forced to go through in transitioning to online platforms.<br><br>
          Now it is Hwasa’s turn to stand in the spotlight. With a comeback that started on June 29, she has been leaving Moomoos
            around the world starstruck with her with her new album “Maria” which came with music video releases for “Maria” and “LMM.”<br><br>
          The album focuses on Hwasa’s self-image, especially as she is no stranger to online hate. For those new to the fandom,
            Hwasa has drawn criticism from the way she dresses and she has been battling the Korean beauty standard for many years
            throughout her professional career. She has been able to freely express herself in Mamamoo’s unorthodox image and style.<br><br>
          Meanwhile Mamamoo as a whole will be part of Online Dream Concert “CONNECT:D” along with other Kpop idols. The concert
            will begin at July 25 and end at July 26. Mamamoo’s performance will be on the second day (in case you’re there to
            watch only them). With how a previous concert of this type went, we can expect around 2-3 performances. But with a
            timespan of two days, it might be longer this time.<br><br>
          Pray that our queens stay safe and healthy during these trying times.<br></p>
