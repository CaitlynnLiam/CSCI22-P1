          <h2>Hwasa’s Comeback and Mamamoo’s Upcoming Concert</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/radish_hwasa.jpg"><br>
            Artists are being forced to adapt to change due to the quarantine caused by COVID-19, so it is to our great pleasure to
            say that Moonbyul’s (concert performance thing) was successful despite the constraints that she and the production team were
            forced to go through in transitioning to online platforms.<br><br>
          Now it is Hwasa’s turn to stand in the spotlight. With a comeback that started on June 29, she has been leaving Moomoos
            around the world starstruck with her with her new album “Maria” which came with music video releases for “Maria” and “LMM.”<br><br>
          The album focuses on Hwasa’s self-image, especially as she is no stranger to online hate. For those new to the fandom,
            Hwasa has drawn criticism from the way she dresses and she has been battling the Korean beauty standard for many years
            throughout her professional career. She has been able to freely express herself in Mamamoo’s unorthodox image and style.<br><br>
          Meanwhile Mamamoo as a whole will be part of Online Dream Concert “CONNECT:D” along with other Kpop idols. The concert
            will begin at July 25 and end at July 26. Mamamoo’s performance will be on the second day (in case you’re there to
            watch only them). With how a previous concert of this type went, we can expect around 2-3 performances. But with a
            timespan of two days, it might be longer this time.<br><br>
          Pray that our queens stay safe and healthy during these trying times.<br></p>

          <h2>The Filipino Moomoo Community and their Lovely Sense of Humor</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/radish_lmm.jpg"><br>
            Being the great fan that I am, I occasionally check Facebook for Moomoos from other parts of the world. I like and
            follow their groups just to show my support. So, I see their posts on my feed for which I have no regrets over as
            the Filipino Moomoo community is popping out some gems I can’t help talking about.<br><br>
          You all saw Hwasa’s new LMM music video, right? Well guess what? They used it for a local event of theirs called
            “Labanos ni Mayor Maria.” At first I didn’t get it, so I put the thing through Google Translate. Apparently, it
            means “Mayor Maria’s Radishes.”<br><br>
          Now that, fellow Moomoos, is pure genius. I spent a solid half hour laughing at it. There are clearly some people
            here who stan because they like MMM’s sense of humor and it shows. I mean we all know that they have zero shame of
            doing funny embarrassing things in front of huge audiences, but this still caught me off-guard.<br><br>
          For those of you who are interested in showing support to our fellows in the Philippines, I will be leaving a link
            to their FB page here.<br>
