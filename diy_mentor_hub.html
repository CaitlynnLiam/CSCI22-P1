          <h2>Safety Precautions for Working with Resin</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/diy_resin.jpg"></img><br>
            I was recently scared out of my wits when I saw a reckless newbie experimenting with resin so I decided to post this.<br>
            “Safety first” should be a general rule for anything, that includes working with resin.<br><br>
            Here is what you <b>ABSOLUTELY</b> need:<br>
            1.	Gloves<br>
            2.	Either a well-ventilated workspace or a respirator<br><br>
            If you get resin on your skin <b>NEVER</b> use the following:<br>
            1.	Varsol<br>
            2.	Vinegar<br>
            3.	Alcohol<br>
            4.	Acetone<br><br>
            You can use the above-mentioned for your materials and workspace; but for your lovely skin, just use soap, even better would be an exfoliant.<br>
            If it gets in you eyes, rinse but don’t rub then get yourself to the hospital <b>IMMEDIATELY.</b><br>
            Keep young children away from the area and ensure that your project is unreachable to them.<br><br>
            Additional things you need to know:<br>
            1.	Even in a well-ventilated area, you can wear an N95 mask if you want to be sure.<br>
            2.	Don’t wear clothes you’re not yet willing to part with because stray resin will ruin them.<br>
            3.	Protect your workspace by covering it with a plastic sheet, or any non-stick sheet you might have.<br><br>
            Alright, have fun and don’t die! :D<br></p>

          <h2>Bookbinding and how to do it</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/diy_book.jpg">
            Please read the entire guide before attempting this.<br><br>
          There are two categories of things you need to prepare.<br><br>
          The first being the covers and signatures (not what you’re thinking of). Signature refers to sheets of paper folded in half and
            put together for the purpose of bookbinding. Poke holes into them by the creases based on what kind of stitch you want to use.
            If you want to use thicker sheets, it’s better to not fold them and just poke holes slightly away from where the book spine is supposed to be.<br><br>
          The next thing you have to prepare are your binding materials and adhesives. This can either be string, glue, or both. There are no specific
            limitations for what kind of string you’re allowed to use. If you are using glue, I would highly recommend PVA glue. For the needle, use a
            curved on as it would make looping around the stitches easier. However, a regular needle can also work.<br><br>
          Putting it together is the next step.<br><br>
          Start by aligning your signatures and knotting the string on one of the holes. I would recommend going to YouTube if you’re unfamiliar with
            stitching for books. You can try searching “kettle stitch.” What you end up doing may vary very wildly based on your stitching choices.
            Finally, glue your cover. You might want to include it in the stitching stage if your cover material is not that thick. You can also put
            glue along the spine for extra reinforcement.<br><br>
          Enjoy your DIY book. :)<br></p>
