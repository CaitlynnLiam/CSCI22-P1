          <h2>How the Environmental Landscape is Changing, Courtesy of COVID-19</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/envi_covid.jpg"></img><br>
            One’s initial reaction to hearing about COVID-19’s impact on the environment might be relief, given that travel would be limited, which would
            decrease carbon emissions from vehicles of all kinds. The quarantine would have also temporarily immobilized some businesses, which could
            potentially lead to a decrease in energy consumption.<br><br>
          Months later, with the statistics from U.S.News, we can say with confidence that it is indeed the case. According to their article,
            there was a 30% decrease in the use of gasoline and jet fuel consumption was cut by half compared to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile
            for power and utilities there was a decrease of almost 20% and there was an almost 10% drop in demand for electricity. This was a 15%
            reduction overall for the U.S., which is a major contributor to global emissions.<br><br>
          However, things are never that simple. While the hinderance to human activity appears to have helped mitigate the damage caused by our
            daily activities, it also stymies the progress being made to transition to cleaner energy sources. As U.S.News notes, investment in low-carbon
            energy was stopped due to the pandemic. The researchers they cited have stated that “pushing back all renewable electricity generation investments
            by one year would outweigh the emissions reductions and avoided deaths from March to June of 2020." This means that while our environmental
            issues seem to be improving on first glance, it is actually worsening in the long run.<br><br>

          <h2>Nature is Adapting to Human Garbage</h2>
          <p><img src="pictures/envi_ideonella_sakaiensis.jpg">
            There are many bad things that people do to the environment. Getting plastic into oceans where they can kill sea life is among the worst of these,
            but just a few months ago, a groundbreaking discovery was made. Researchers from Japan have discovered a new type of bacteria called <i>ideonella sakaiensis</i>
            which has mutated the ability to eat plastic in as quickly as 6 weeks. Yes, remember all those times when we were told that plastic can take centuries to fully
            break down? This is nature’s response to our incompetence as a species.<br><br>
          Of course, this is no excuse to run around dumping garbage everywhere “now that it’s not that bad.” First of all, this type of bacteria is not common and is
            hard to grow. Then, throwing plastic into the ocean willy-nilly can still cause animal deaths when they accidentally eat them. We don’t want that to
            happen, <b>RIGHT?</b><br><br>
